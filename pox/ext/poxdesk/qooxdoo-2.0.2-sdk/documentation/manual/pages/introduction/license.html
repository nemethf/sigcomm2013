<div class="line">of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence</div>
<div class="line">the version number 2.1.]</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Preamble</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</div>
<div class="line">Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change</div>
<div class="line">free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some</div>
</div>
<div class="line">specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You</div>
<div class="line">can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether</div>
<div class="line">this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better</div>
<div class="line">strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that</div>
<div class="line">you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge</div>
<div class="line">for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get</div>
<div class="line">it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of</div>
<div class="line">it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do</div>
<div class="line">these things.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</div>
</div>
<div class="line">distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these</div>
<div class="line">rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for</div>
<div class="line">you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis</div>
</div>
<div class="line">or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave</div>
<div class="line">you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source</div>
<div class="line">code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide</div>
<div class="line">complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them</div>
<div class="line">with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling</div>
<div class="line">it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal</div>
<div class="line">permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that</div>
</div>
<div class="line">there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is</div>
<div class="line">modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know</div>
<div class="line">that what they have is not the original version, so that the original</div>
<div class="line">author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be</div>
<div class="line">introduced by others.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of</div>
</div>
<div class="line">any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot</div>
<div class="line">effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a</div>
<div class="line">restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that</div>
<div class="line">any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be</div>
<div class="line">consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser</div>
<div class="line">General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and</div>
<div class="line">is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use</div>
<div class="line">this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those</div>
<div class="line">libraries into non-free programs.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using</div>
</div>
<div class="line">a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a</div>
<div class="line">combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary</div>
<div class="line">General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the</div>
<div class="line">entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General</div>
<div class="line">Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with</div>
<div class="line">the library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it</div>
</div>
<div class="line">does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General</div>
<div class="line">Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less</div>
<div class="line">of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages</div>
<div class="line">are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many</div>
<div class="line">libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain</div>
<div class="line">special circumstances.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to</div>
</div>
<div class="line">encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes</div>
<div class="line">a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be</div>
<div class="line">allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free</div>
<div class="line">library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this</div>
<div class="line">case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free</div>
<div class="line">software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free</div>
</div>
<div class="line">programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of</div>
<div class="line">free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in</div>
<div class="line">non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU</div>
<div class="line">operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating</div>
<div class="line">system.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is</div>
<div class="line">linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run</div>
<div class="line">that program using a modified version of the Library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</div>
</div>
<div class="line">modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a</div>
<div class="line">&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The</div>
<div class="line">former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must</div>
<div class="line">be combined with the library in order to run.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</div>
</div>
<div class="line">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other</div>
</div>
<div class="line">program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or</div>
<div class="line">other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).</div>
<div class="line">Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data</div>
</div>
<div class="line">prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs</div>
<div class="line">(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work</div>
</div>
<div class="line">which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under</div>
<div class="line">copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a</div>
<div class="line">portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is</div>
<div class="line">included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for</div>
</div>
<div class="line">making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means</div>
<div class="line">all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated</div>
<div class="line">interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation</div>
<div class="line">and installation of the library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</div>
</div>
<div class="line">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</div>
<div class="line">running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from</div>
<div class="line">such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for</div>
<div class="line">writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does</div>
<div class="line">and what the program that uses the Library does.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's</div>
</div>
<div class="line">complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that</div>
<div class="line">you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an</div>
<div class="line">appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact</div>
<div class="line">all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any</div>
<div class="line">warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,</div>
</div>
<div class="line">and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a</div>
<div class="line">fee.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion</div>
</div>
<div class="line">of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and</div>
<div class="line">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</div>
<div class="line">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) The modified work must itself be a software library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices</div>
<div class="line">stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no</div>
<div class="line">charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a</div>
<div class="line">table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses</div>
<div class="line">the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility</div>
<div class="line">is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,</div>
<div class="line">in the event an application does not supply such function or</div>
<div class="line">table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of</div>
<div class="line">its purpose remains meaningful.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has</div>
<div class="line">a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the</div>
<div class="line">application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any</div>
<div class="line">application-supplied function or table used by this function must</div>
<div class="line">be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square</div>
<div class="line">root function must still compute square roots.)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</div>
<div class="line">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,</div>
<div class="line">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</div>
<div class="line">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</div>
<div class="line">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</div>
<div class="line">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</div>
<div class="line">on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</div>
<div class="line">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</div>
<div class="line">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote</div>
<div class="line">it.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</div>
<div class="line">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</div>
<div class="line">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</div>
<div class="line">collective works based on the Library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library</div>
<div class="line">with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of</div>
<div class="line">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</div>
<div class="line">the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public</div>
</div>
<div class="line">License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do</div>
<div class="line">this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so</div>
<div class="line">that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,</div>
<div class="line">instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify</div>
<div class="line">that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in</div>
<div class="line">these notices.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for</div>
</div>
<div class="line">that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all</div>
<div class="line">subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of</div>
</div>
<div class="line">the Library into a program that is not a library.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or</div>
</div>
<div class="line">derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form</div>
<div class="line">under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany</div>
<div class="line">it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which</div>
<div class="line">must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a</div>
<div class="line">medium customarily used for software interchange.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy</div>
</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the</div>
<div class="line">source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to</div>
<div class="line">distribute the source code, even though third parties are not</div>
<div class="line">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or</div>
<div class="line">linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a</div>
<div class="line">work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and</div>
<div class="line">therefore falls outside the scope of this License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library</div>

<div class="line">creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it</div>

<div class="line">library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.</div>
<div class="line">Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>

<div class="line">When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file</div>

<div class="line">Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by</div>
<div class="line">this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work</div>
<div class="line">during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference</div>
<div class="line">directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one</div>
<div class="line">of these things:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding</div>
<div class="line">machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever</div>
<div class="line">changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under</div>
<div class="line">Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked</div>
<div class="line">with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that</div>
<div class="line">uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the</div>
<div class="line">user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified</div>
<div class="line">executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood</div>
<div class="line">that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the</div>
<div class="line">Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application</div>
<div class="line">to use the modified definitions.)</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the</div>
<div class="line">Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a</div>
<div class="line">copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,</div>
<div class="line">rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)</div>
<div class="line">will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if</div>
<div class="line">the user installs one, as long as the modified version is</div>
<div class="line">interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at</div>
<div class="line">least three years, to give the same user the materials</div>
<div class="line">specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more</div>
<div class="line">than the cost of performing this distribution.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy</div>
<div class="line">from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above</div>
<div class="line">specified materials from the same place.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these</div>
<div class="line">materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the</div>
</div>
<div class="line">Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for</div>
<div class="line">reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,</div>
<div class="line">the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is</div>
<div class="line">normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major</div>
<div class="line">components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on</div>
<div class="line">which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license</div>
</div>
<div class="line">restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work</div>

<div class="line">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest</div>
</div>
<div class="line">possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that</div>
<div class="line">everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting</div>
<div class="line">redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the</div>
<div class="line">ordinary General Public License).</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is</div>
</div>
<div class="line">safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (&quot;AGREEMENT&quot;). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">1. DEFINITIONS</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">i) changes to the Program, and</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">ii) additions to the Program;</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">3. REQUIREMENTS</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) its license agreement:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">When the Program is made available in source code form:</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</div>
