Tutorial: How to create a qooxdoo mobile twitter client
=======================================================

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a simple Twitter client with the new qooxdoo mobile widgets. The client should display all tweets of a certain user. When a tweet is selected, the details of the tweet should be shown. You can find the full tutorial [here](http://manual.qooxdoo.org/devel/pages/mobile/tutorial.html).

Requirements
------------

Although this should be a basic tutorial, you should be at least familiar with the tool chain and the basic object oriented principles of qooxdoo. A working qooxdoo environment is mandatory. Target version of this tutorial is the "trunk" version of qooxdoo. As qooxdoo is based on web technologies, you will need a running instance of Google Chrome or Apple Safari browser on your system to run the application (see qooxdoo mobile requirements). An iOS or Android device is not necessarily required.
